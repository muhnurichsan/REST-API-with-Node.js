### What is REST API?
The term REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It is an architectural style that defines a set of rules in order to create Web Services. 
In a client-server communication, REST suggests to create an object of the data requested by the client and send the values of the object in response to the user. 
For example, if the user is requesting for a movie in Bangalore at a certain place and time, then you can create an object on the server-side (credit:edureka.co)

### Sequelize
Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading

### Expressjs
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

### dotenv
Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.
